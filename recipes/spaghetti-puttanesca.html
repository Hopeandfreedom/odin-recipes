            <p>The unique flavor of spaghetti alla puttanesca comes from the flavorsome sauce it’s dressed in: peeled tomatoes, Gaeta olives, capers, and anchovy fillets. And the dish is also made tastier by its unusual name: Puttanesca literally means “of, relating to, or characteristic of a prostitute,” raising questions about its origins, which are claimed by both the region of Lazio and Campania. 
            </p>
            <p>The most salacious and imaginative stories say that it originated in brothels, as a super quick dish to prepared with just a few simple ingredients. Others point to the culinary fantasies of the legendary performer Antonio De Curtis, AKA Totò. Others still say spaghetti alla puttanesca was first eaten in Ischia at the famous Rangio Fellone restaurant in the 1950s, where it was created one night with whatever was leftover in the pantry, and the colorful name came from the fact that it was an easy dish thrown together in a quick, improvised way. From then on, it seems that it became a fixture on the restaurant’s menu and then spread beyond the island as one of the first courses of the Italian culinary tradition.
