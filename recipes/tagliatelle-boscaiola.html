            <h2 class="hbox">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
            <strong>START WITH THE FRESH PASTA</strong>
            <br>
                <li>Pour the flour onto a pastry board and create the classic fountain shape; <br>place the eggs in the center.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add a drizzle of oil. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Add a pinch of salt.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Initially work by beating with a fork. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Then help yourself with a dough scraper. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Knead until you have a uniform mixture</li>
                <br>
                <li>Wrap the dough in a plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes in a cool place.</li>
                <br>
            <strong>TAKE CARE OF THE PORCINIS</strong>
            <br>
                <li>Remove the larger soil residues with a knife, then clean them with a damp cloth.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Separate the caps from the stems.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut the mushrooms into cubes about 1-2 inches</li>
                <br>
            <strong>MOVE ON TO THE SAUSAGE</strong>
                <br>
                <li>Remove the outer casing.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Crumble it coarsely by hand to form balls about an inch in size.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large pan, pour some oil and the chopped shallot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Let it fry gently, then add the sausage and mushrooms.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stir well, brown them thoroughly, and deglaze with white wine.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Once the alcohol has evaporated, pour in the crushed peeled tomatoes with a fork or by hand.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stir well and cover with a lid; let it cook for about 25 minutes</li>
                <br>
                <li>Take the fresh pasta again as soon as the resting time is over.<br> Take a piece and sprinkle it with flour.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Use a pasta machine to thin it out; <br>pass it several times through the rollers until you get a thickness of about 1/8 inch.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can fold the pasta on itself as you go to obtain a homogeneous sheet. <br> Once you have the sheet, cut out rectangles of pasta.</li>
                <br>
                <li>At this point, roll the pasta rectangle first from one side and then from the other without tightening.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut the tagliatelle with a knife to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Then wrap them around your hand to form a nest and continue with the others. </li>
                <br>
                <li>At this point, the sauce will be ready. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Cook the tagliatelle in plenty of salted water.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Once cooked after a few minutes, drain them and transfer them directly into the sauce.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add plenty of chopped parsley. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Saut√© everything well, adding cooking water if needed. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Plate, finish with grated Parmesan.</li>
