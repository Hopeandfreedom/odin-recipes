        <p>
            Saffron is an ancient spice, already known in Egyptian times. At first it was only used to dye fabrics and make perfumes and ointments, but once its amazing culinary properties were discovered, it became a precious ingredient with which to make tasty dishes with golden hues, such as saffron risotto or pasta. This first course, in its simplicity, best enhances the aromatic qualities of saffron. But that's not all: with its strong coloring power, the grains of rice take on an inviting golden color that makes this dish so special. A little magic that, combined with the creamy touch of the final stirring technique, inevitable in the preparation of risottos, will result in a dish with a unique and unmistakable taste. And to make this dish even more captivating, you will be helped by Greek mythology that tells the legendary and hampered love relationship of the young Crocus, the seductive nymph Smilax, and the god Hermes, who, blinded by jealousy, transformed Crocus into a delicate saffron flower.
